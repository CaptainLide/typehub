Typing Game concept:

1. User has 60 seconds to complete x number of words. 
2. If user completes x number of words within 60 seconds user then proceeds to next level. 
3. x number of words is multiple by 1.15 per completion. 
4. after 3 cycles required number of seconds is lowered. 
Extra: 95% accuracy so user's can make a few mistakes, 4 levels with different WPM goals, user gets list of words used after


For Example:

1. 60 seconds complete 50 words first cycle 
2. user then proceeds to complete 75 in 60 seconds after completion
3. after 3 cycles (user can type roughly 80 wpm) 
4. keep same number 80 words but reduce time to 50 seconds (decrease by 10 seconds each cycle)

Creative:
User chooses own time limit, words to use, and accuracy

For Visuals: 
1. Minimalistic feel (side scroller) 
2. each completed word moves model to the right to progress through side scroller

APIs Used:
- random words
